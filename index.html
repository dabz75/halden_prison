                                Halden Prison, the second-largest one in Norway, was founded in 2010 with a strong desire to
                                make rehabilitation possible for its inmates with “real life simulations”.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At first, it can seem crazy or even unimaginable to think about building a real town inside a
                                prison for dangerous criminals such as rapists, murderers, child molesters or drug offenders.
                                Indeed, this is what makes Halden Prison very special, different from the other ones. 
                                Fredrik Sjøli, Senior Adviser of the Directorate of Norwegian Correctional Services, 
                                explained clearly through a personal interview how the Prison System in Norway has been working for decades.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h2>- Do you think, this System works better than prison systems in other countries and is it more efficient, 
                            based on the reoffender rate?</h2>
                            <p>“In general, there is – and has been for decades - a consensus about the Correctional Service’s main goals 
                            and objectives within the Norwegian political sphere and in the Norwegian society as such. This means that we 
                            believe that our approach is a good, efficient and humanistic approach. It is outside our scope of responsibility 
                            to evaluate other countries penal systems.”
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Designed in the image of a kind of small village, this prison aims at creating a “mirror”
                                between life inside and outside the blocks. Therefore, you can find out painted walls with
                                different kinds of arts, realistic streets, and many buildings.

                                As every place you can live in, many infrastructures have been built, such as a school, a library,
                                a workplace, and even a football field. The place has been thought so that everyone can do all
                                kinds of activities, like studying, reading, playing music, practicing some sports.
                            </p>

                            <br>
                            <h2>- Is it possible to attend education and other activities in every Prison in Norway or is it just 
                            available in some prisons?</h2>
                            <p>“It is available in all prisons. According to Section 3 of the Execution of Sentences Act.”
                            </p>
                            <br>


                            <p>
                                This ideal life is the reason why the inmates are free and encouraged to spend as much time
                                as possible outside all day long. No matter what you did before or who you are, Halden Prison
                                reminds you first of what it is to have human rights.
                            </p>

                            <div class="textImage">
                                <img src="resources/IMG_0720.JPG">
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>“The smaller the difference between life inside and outside prison, the easier should be the transition from 
                                prison to freedom. In accordance with the principle of normality, progression through a sentence should be 
                                aimed as much as possible at returning to the community. The more closed a system is, the harder it will be 
                                to return to freedom.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Living in this place as an inmate seems to be utopian. For instance, 10m² of living-room equipped
                                by a flat-screen TV, a desk, a mini-fridge, a toilet with a shower, with a common kitchen and dinning room.
                                Everything you need has been made available so you are free to cook your own meals.

                                Relationships are also important for the inmates. Receiving families, partners or friends privately is allowed
                                twice a week and for two hours. This bridge between life inside and outside the blocks has been
                                made so that every inmates don’t fall into any kind of depression.
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h2>- How are the Prisoners behaving with each other? Are there gang problems like for example in prisons in America?</h2>
                            <p>“Of course there will be unwanted incidents in a prison, but – as a benchmark - the only time an inmate has been killed 
                            in prison in recent time, was in 2017 in Ringerike prison. Our security "recipe" consists of dynamic, static and organisational 
                            means. In the Norwegian Correctional Service we put a lot of emphasis on giving our staff a proper training and recruits have to 
                            undergo a two-year education, where the consciousness about ethics, values and attitudes plays a central role. Establishing a 
                            respectful relation to the inmates is also basic for the risk assessment, and is part of the dynamic security of the prison. 
                            Compared to many other countries, we also have a high ratio of staff.”
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                “Dynamic security”, that is also what makes Halden Prison different from the other ones.
                                Staff members such as teachers, healthcare workers, personal trainers and even guards, are
                                pushed to create interpersonal relationships with the inmates. As a consequence, they can spend
                                their time doing activities together, get to know each other, and create a daily strong routine.
                            </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Despite this ideal life for its inmates, the architects of Halden Prison made sure about putting
                                in place a high security measure inside the blocks. The big grey walls, visible everywhere around
                                this place, has been solidly built in the image of a real deterrent for the inmates. Behind this
                                wall is the real thing that they lost: “Freedom”.
                            </p>

                            <br>
                            <p>“It is important to note, however that dynamic security alone is not sufficient to ensure a healthy and safe prison environment. 
                                Dynamic security must be backed by a serious disciplinary code for dealing with bad behaviour, and sanctions must be a part of the system.”</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Halden Prison is considered as “the place-to-be” for many people in the world, because of the treatment given to its inmates.
                                Nevertheless, it has a huge security system that remains stable and efficient against escape until today in Norway.
                                Secured place, but also ideal inside for dangerous criminals, offering many opportunities to escape… Now, the question is:
                                For how long will Halden Prison remain a safe place?
